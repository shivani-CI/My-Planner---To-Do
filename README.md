### <ins> Design</ins>

  #### Colour Scheme

  The colour scheme for this application has been thoughtfully designed with a focus on creating a calming and inviting user experience. The palette primarily features a blend of aqua green and aqua blue tones, chosen for their soothing and tranquil properties. These colors evoke a sense of calm and clarity, making the interface both aesthetically pleasing and easy on the eyes during extended use.

  The aqua green provides a refreshing and natural feel, reminiscent of serene waters, while the aqua blue adds a touch of coolness and depth. Together, they create a balanced and harmonious environment that promotes relaxation and focus.

  Complementing these primary colors, a clean and crisp white is used to enhance readability and provide a sense of openness and simplicity. The white background serves as a neutral canvas that highlights the aqua tones, ensuring that the interface remains uncluttered and visually appealing.

  To complete the palette, black is employed for text and key interface elements, offering strong contrast and ensuring clear, legible content. The black accents also add a touch of sophistication and balance to the overall design.

  This combination of aqua green, aqua blue, white, and black is carefully curated not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its calming effects, contributing to a user experience that is both peaceful and engaging.

  #### Typography

  Google Fonts is used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site. I have chosen to use Raleway and sans-serif fonts.

  #### Imagery

  The imagery used in the application has been meticulously selected to enhance visual appeal and support the overall design theme.

  - Right Side Image: The right-side image is sourced from Pexels. This image has been chosen for its high-quality and relevant depiction that complements the calming color scheme of the application. Its serene and engaging visual elements help to create a cohesive and immersive user experience, reinforcing the tranquil and inviting atmosphere of the interface.

  - Icon Image for Web Title: The icon used for the web title is sourced from Pixabay, serves as a crucial visual element that enhances brand recognition and adds a polished touch to the application. This icon is selected for its clarity, relevance, and aesthetic alignment with the overall design. By sourcing the icon from Pixabay and carefully converting it into a favicon, the application ensures that they are of high quality.

  By leveraging high-quality, royalty-free images from these reputable sources, the application not only maintains a visually appealing and professional look but also ensures that all graphical elements are consistent with the design principles and enhance the overall user experience.
 
  The application utilizes Font Awesome to enhance its visual design by incorporating a range of icons for various task categories. Icons for different task types — list tasks, important tasks, planned tasks, and flagged tasks are sourced from Font Awesome.

  The icons used for different tasks categories help users quickly identify and differentiate between various task entries, making task management more efficient.
