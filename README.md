  #### Typography

    Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site. I have chosen to use Raleway and sans-serif fonts.

  #### Imagery

   Used Pixels for hero image and Pixabay for the icon.
 
   Font Awesome was used to import icons for list tasks, important tasks, planned tasks and flagged tasks.

### <ins> Testing and Responsiveness</ins>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2bf5f3d-6eb7-4062-bebb-d82feb9fae26)


Testing was part ongoing process throughout the entire build. I used Chrome developer tools whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues.

I also utilised the console in the developer tools to work through small sections of JavaScript and ensure that the code was working, and also to troubleshoot issues.

I was constantly checking if my app is responsive on different screen sizes and devices.

Not just that, I also tested all features manually to ensure app is working and providing great user experience.

I also used W3 Validation service to check the HMTL, W3C CSS Validator for CSS, and JShint to validate the JavaScript. There are no errors in my code.
