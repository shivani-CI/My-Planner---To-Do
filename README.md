### <ins>UX - User stories</ins>

1. As a user I want to enter a description of task, select a due date, and choose a category so that I can add a new task to my planner with all necessary details

2. As a user I want see my tasks displayed in list so that I can view the task description, due date, category and have option to mark it as complete, edit or delete.

3. As a user I want to edit the task description so that I can update information

4. As a user I want to categories tasks(e.g., Work, Personal) so that I can filter them based on the category.

5. As a user I want to search for tasks so that I can quickly find specific tasks in my list


### <ins> Design</ins>

  #### Colour Scheme

  I wanted to choose colours that have calming properties, so I have chosen a variety of aqua green, aqua blue, white and black to achieve this.

  #### Typography

  Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site. I have chosen to use Raleway and sans-serif fonts.

  #### Imagery

  Used Pixels for hero image and Pixabay for the icon.
 
  Font Awesome was used to import icons for list tasks, important tasks, planned tasks and flagged tasks.

### <ins> Testing and Responsiveness</ins>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2bf5f3d-6eb7-4062-bebb-d82feb9fae26)


Testing was part ongoing process throughout the entire build. I used Chrome developer tools whilst building to find and troubleshoot any issues and errors.

I also utilised the console in the developer tools to work through small sections of JavaScript and ensure that the code was working, and also to troubleshoot issues.

I was constantly checking if my app is responsive on different screen sizes and devices.

Not just that, I also tested all features manually to ensure app is working and providing great user experience.

I also used W3 Validation service to check the HMTL, W3C CSS Validator for CSS, and JShint to validate the JavaScript. There are no errors in my code.
